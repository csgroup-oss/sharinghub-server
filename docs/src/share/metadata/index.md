# Metadata

Metadata refers to data that provides information about other data. It offers context, description, and structure to aid in the understanding, organization, and management of data.

To understand our metadata, knowledge of basic [STAC Concepts](./stac-concepts.md) is recommended. If you already know how STAC works, you can dive into our [project metadata](./project/common.md).
