Welcome to our **AI-focused** web portal, SharingHub, designed to help you discover, navigate, and analyze your AI-related **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** projects hosted on **[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)**. Here you can download code, models and datasets with our interface focused on navigation and accessibility!

We take inspiration from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), the most used AI sharing website in the world, but our goal is turned towards the geospatial component, with **GIS capabilities**, with datasets and AI models referenced in space and time. This portal is intended to improve exchanges and collaboration between scientists by integrating voting mechanisms, code reviews, and the complete management of the shared assets life cycle.

Very light, SharingHub is deployed on top of a GitLab instance, and dynamically extracts metadata from the shared projects to serve them through its web interface, as well as a normalized API, **[STAC](https://stacspec.org)**. We can deliver large datasets with a DVC remote (S3 store), automatically deploy AI models, discover DOI links, among other features.
